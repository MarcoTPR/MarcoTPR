Hi, I'm @MarcoTPR.
I'm interested about electrical engineering control systems. I'm currently learning about how CompactLogix L16ER PLC 
and PanelView HMI work and its sofware relate to them. After I've finished studing those, I'll beging learnig about 
Siemens S7-1500 PLC. Also, I plan to study HAAS VF1-VF2 CNC mill and lathe machines.
